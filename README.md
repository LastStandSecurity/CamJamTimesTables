# CamJamTimesTables

This is a simple times tables game intended for Primary School age children.

It is based on the components you get with the CamJam Edukit2 bundle, which can be found here: https://camjam.me/?page_id=623

The idea is that it asks a set of times tables questions, illuminating the blue LED if the answer is correct, or the red LED if the answer is wrong. There are lots of improvements that could be made to the code, including adding a timer to test how long it takes the child to answer the questions. Please feel free to take copies and improve as you see fit. 

This is a very simple code snippet and should go without saying that the code comes with no warranties, guarantees or promises of ongoing support and maintenance.
